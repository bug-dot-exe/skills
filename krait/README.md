## What Krait Does

Krait is a structured audit methodology encoded as Claude Code skills. When you run `/krait` on a Solidity project, it executes a 4-phase pipeline:

1. **Recon** — maps the architecture, extracts the AST, scores every file by risk, selects protocol-specific detection primers
2. **Detection** — analyzes each high-risk function from 16 angles (4 technical lenses x 4 independent mindsets), with consensus scoring across passes
3. **State Analysis** — finds coupled state pairs and mutation patterns that per-function scanning misses
4. **Verification** — 8 kill gates try to disprove every finding. Only those with a concrete exploit trace (WHO does WHAT to steal HOW MUCH) survive

The output is a structured report with findings at exact file:line locations, vulnerable code, suggested fixes, and exploit traces. Saved as both markdown and JSON.

## What Krait Is Not

- Not a linter or regex scanner — Claude reads and reasons about code
- Not a SaaS product with API costs — runs locally in your Claude Code session
- Not a replacement for a professional audit — it's a tool that catches real bugs before your auditor does

---

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (CLI, VS Code extension, or Cursor)
- A Claude subscription (Pro, Max, or Team)
- A Solidity project to audit

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZealynxSecurity/krait.git
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands ~/.claude/skills
cp -r krait/.claude/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
cp -r krait/.claude/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

Open Claude Code in any Solidity project and run `/krait`.

### Update

```bash
cd krait && git pull
cp -r .claude/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
cp -r .claude/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Optional: Pattern Search MCP Server

Krait includes an MCP server that lets you search 47 vulnerability patterns locally. No API key needed.

```bash
cd krait/mcp-servers/solodit
npm install && npm run build
```

The `.mcp.json` in the repo root auto-configures it for Claude Code. The skills work fine without the MCP server — it's an optional pattern search tool for development.

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/krait` | Full 4-phase audit: Recon → Detection → State Analysis → Verification → Report |
| `/krait-quick` | Same pipeline, skips state analysis — ~2x faster |
| `/krait-review` | Second opinion on killed findings — re-examines aggressive gate decisions |

All output to `.audit/` in your project directory.

### After the Audit

Every run saves findings to `.audit/krait-findings.json` and shows:

```
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
📋 N findings saved to .audit/krait-findings.json

🔗 View this report online:
   https://krait.zealynx.io/report/findings

📊 Track findings over time:
   https://krait.zealynx.io/dashboard
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Findings are already verified — the critic phase requires a concrete exploit trace for every H/M before it reaches the report.

If the critic killed many candidates, run `/krait-review` to get a second opinion on the gate decisions.

---

## How Detection Works

### Multi-Mindset Analysis (v7.0)

Each of the 4 detection lenses analyzes code through 4 independent mindsets simultaneously:

| Mindset | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **Attacker** | "How would I exploit this to drain funds or escalate privilege?" |
| **Accountant** | "Trace every wei — do the numbers add up?" |
| **Spec Auditor** | "Does the code match what docs, comments, and EIPs say it should do?" |
| **Edge Case Hunter** | "What breaks at zero, max, empty, self-referential, or reentrant?" |

Every function in high-risk files gets examined from **16 angles** (4 lenses x 4 mindsets). Findings discovered by multiple mindsets get a consensus boost; single-source findings get extra scrutiny.

### Kill Gates (Verification)

Eight automatic gates try to **disprove every finding** before it reaches you:

- **A**: Generic best practice ("use SafeERC20") · **B**: Theoretical/unrealistic
- **C**: Intentional design · **D**: Speculative (no WHO/WHAT/HOW MUCH)
- **E**: Admin trust · **F**: Dust (<$100) · **G**: Out of context · **H**: Known issue

Result: FPs dropped from 4.2/contest → 0.0/contest in v7 (**100% reduction**). The last 10 contests (v6.4+v7) had only 1 total FP across 10 contests.

### Second Opinion (`/krait-review`)

The kill gates are aggressive by design — zero false positives is the priority. But aggressive gates can over-kill. Run `/krait-review` after an audit to re-examine killed findings with fresh eyes:

- **Gate C** (intentional design) — "intentional" doesn't always mean "safe"
- **Gate E** (admin trust) — missing timelocks and rug vectors are valid Mediums in many contests
- **Gate B** (theoretical) — retries exploit construction with flash loans, multi-block MEV
- **Gate F** (dust) — recalculates with protocol TVL context and accumulation analysis

Revived findings are surfaced as **"Worth Manual Review"** — flags for the auditor, not verified TPs. The main report's zero-FP standard is preserved.

## Benchmarks

Tested blind against 50 Code4rena contests. No other AI audit tool publishes precision/recall against real competitions.

| Version | Contests | Precision | Recall | FPs/Contest |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| v1 | 1-3 | 12% | 5.8% | 1.3 |
| v5 | 31-35 | 70% | 9.5% | 0.6 |
| v6.4 | 36-40 | 90% | 11.8% | 0.2 |
| v7 | 41-45 | 100% | 11.0% | 0.0 |
| **v8** | **46-50** | **100%** | **15.2%** | **0.0** |

**Latest 5 contests (v8):**

| Contest | Type | Official H+M | TPs | FPs | Precision | Recall |
|---------|------|-------------|-----|-----|-----------|--------|
| PoolTogether | ERC-4626 Prize Vault | 9 | 1 | 0 | **100%** | 11% |
| GoodEntry | UniV3 Derivatives | 14 | 5 | 0 | **100%** | **36%** |
| Arcade | Governance/Voting | 8 | 2 | 0 | **100%** | **25%** |
| Frankencoin | CDP Stablecoin | 20 | 2 | 0 | **100%** | 10% |
| InitCapital | Lending/Hooks | 15 | 0 | 0 | N/A | 0% |

Every result is verifiable in [`shadow-audits/`](shadow-audits/).

### Self-Improving

After each blind test: score → root-cause every miss → update methodology → re-test. This loop produced 43 original heuristics, 15 deep-dive module files, 58 extended heuristics, 26 inline modules, and 7 protocol-specific primers. v8 integrated open-source vectors from [pashov/skills](https://github.com/pashov/skills), [PlamenTSV/plamen](https://github.com/PlamenTSV/plamen), and [forefy/.context](https://github.com/forefy/.context) (all MIT) — improving recall from 11% to 15.2% while maintaining 100% precision.

## Detection Coverage

**Strong on**: Reentrancy/CEI, access control gaps, oracle issues (Chainlink + Pyth), EIP/ERC compliance, first-depositor inflation, accounting errors, assembly bugs, pause bypasses, slot0/spot price manipulation, ERC-4626 vault accounting, governance voting power sync, AMM/MEV vectors

**Improving**: Complex math (CDP liquidation, options pricing), cross-chain edge cases, game mechanic exploits, custom hook/plugin architectures, protocol-specific integrations (Curve adapter edge cases)

## Web Platform — [krait.zealynx.io](https://krait.zealynx.io)

### Verify with AI (Unique Feature)

Every security check on the web platform generates a **tailored AI prompt** you can copy-paste into Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or Codex. The prompt includes:

- The specific vulnerability to look for
- Real exploit examples from Solodit (protocols that were actually hacked)
- What secure code looks like (from mitigation data)
- Code patterns to grep for
- Structured output format (PASS/FAIL/NA with file:line references)

When you paste the AI's response back, Krait **auto-parses** it:
- Detects the verdict (PASS/FAIL/NOT APPLICABLE/NEEDS REVIEW)
- Extracts file:line references
- Scores confidence (high/medium/low)
- Auto-sets the check status

This turns every check from "do you think you're ok?" into "let's verify against your actual code with AI."

### Upload & View Reports
